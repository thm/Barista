# Barista
Alternative dark coding theme for [Espresso](http://espressoapp.com). I've been using this theme for a while and thought I'd share it here.

### Languages Supported
The theme currently supports HTML, PHP, CSS, JavaScript, JSON and Markdown. Although I'm not a Ruby or Python developer, both  languages look fine to me with this theme.

### Preview
Here's a preview of what CSS would look like with this theme.
