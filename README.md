# Barista
Barista is a dark coding theme for [Espresso App](http://www.macrabbit.com/espresso/).

### Languages Supported
The theme currently supports HTML, PHP, CSS, JavaScript, JSON and Markdown. Although I'm not a Ruby or Python developer both  languages look fine to me with this theme.

### Installation
1. Quit Espresso if it's still open.
2. Navigate to `Applications > Espresso > Contents > SharedSupport > Themes` in Finder.
3. Copy the `Barista.css` file into the `Themes` folder.
4. Open Espresso and go to `Espresso > Preferences` in the menubar.
5. Select the theme from the menu found under the third tab.
6. Done. Happy coding.
