# Barista
Barista is a dark coding theme for [Espresso](http://www.macrabbit.com/espresso/).

### Supported Languages
The theme currently supports HTML, PHP, CSS, JavaScript, JSON and Markdown. Although I'm not an expert, Ruby and Python both look fine to me with this theme as well.

### Installation
1. Navigate to `Applications > Espresso > Contents > SharedSupport > Themes` in Finder
2. Copy the `Barista.css` file into the `Themes` folder
3. Restart Espresso and go to `Espresso > Preferences` in the menubar
4. Select the theme from the menu found under the third tab

### Preview
